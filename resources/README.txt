//Details of system Setup

SVFX_ModuleBox_Master - Is the master spreadsheet that gets copied out and adjusted for every mark sheet

MarkingData_Template.json - Do not touch this file. It is meant as a demonstration of how the information is laid out for this system.

Duplicate MarkingData_Template.json and rename it to MarkingData.json
	- This MarkingData.json file should then have all the local paths within the file updated to suit your computer files structure. So everyone writes out to where you anticipate it going. This should be in the resources folder of the SVFX_TheRubricsCube repository
